# description of problem and solution

problem is json data and have to visualise in front end.
There are fooitems in some object and in some are not so have to check that also

# solution focus on frontend

# reasoning behind your techical choices, including architectural

for ui react is used and for state management and side effect redux-saga.
redux-saga is used because it makes flow of data so clear and more controlable with its asyncrons look like generator function.
here we have 5 main folder layout, components, redux, ui, view
for ui i used material ui beacause in react world it is becoming standard ui for fast paced development on top of that it built upon react so much helpful.

# trade off if you have more time what you have done

The release date of project i'm working on(my current office) is this thursday so i only worked on this project is only saturday about like 10 hours.If i have had more time surely more feature and more polished ui have achieved.
