# Description of problem and solution

Challenge is data is given in json data and have to visualise in front end and make user friendly
One of the problem is there are fooditems in some object and in some are not so have to check that also

# Solution focus on frontend

# Reasoning behind your techical choices, including architectural

For ui react is used and for state management and side effect redux-saga.
redux-saga is used because it makes flow of data so clear and more controlable with it's asyncrons look like generator function.
here we have 5 main folder layout, components, redux, ui, view.

For ui i used material ui beacause in react world it is becoming standard ui for fast paced development on top of that it built upon react so much helpful.

# Trade off if you have more time what you have done

# I'v not completed some of feature because

I have implemented features like search by food items and shows them on cards.
I'm running on tight schedule and doing over time because of release date.

If i had more time, feature on google maps like current location, distance between user and nearest food truck and markers on googles map. all the truck location marker on maps show them according to the searched result.
also save data in mongodb or dynamodb and connect them to front via api also make user to login and give food ratings and notify users if new deal or offers are available.
